### What I learned

I have learned a lot by building this project. Some of them were new to me. The most intresting peice of code I learned is [Object.values()](https://devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/object/values) property in javascript. Axios made it very easy for me to fetch API requests. In this project I created theme toggle to dark mode and stored the prefered theme in local storage so when they visit again it stay's the same them. I am really proud of this project because I built it on my own without following any tutorial on youtube.(with documentation's help)
