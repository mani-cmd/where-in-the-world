## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   [ViteJs](https://vitejs.dev/) - JS library
-   [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor
-   [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - For fetching API's

### What I learned

I have learned a lot by building this project. Some of them were new to me. The most intresting peice of code I learned is [Object.values()](https://devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/object/values) property in javascript. Axios made it very easy for me to fetch API requests. In this project I created theme toggle to dark mode and stored the prefered theme in local storage so when they visit again it stay's the same them. I am really proud of this project because I built it on my own without following any tutorial on youtube.(with documentation's help)
